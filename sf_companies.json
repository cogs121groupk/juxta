          "pros": "Yelp has an awesome company culture. It is a fun, open, and challenging work environment. There is a lot I could say, so I'll just start putting down bullet points:\r\n\r\n* Excellent company values, particularly \"play well with others\". Most engineers at Yelp are friendly, helpful, and pretty easy to work with. Sure, there are some employees that don't adhere to this value, but in my experience many of these folks end up leaving Yelp.\r\n* Great benefits. In addition to the standard health/dental, Yelp provides up to $60 per month for their wellness program, that can be used for gyms or other fitness activities. Additionally, the company has 3 two-day hackathons each year, where the engineers can work on whatever project they want. And, there are 4 \"off-sites\" each year where each engineering team goes to do something fun together, and 2 company-wide events per year. \r\n* A very open and accepting work culture. There were people at Yelp from so many different backgrounds. E.g. during lunch a muslim engineer would silent perform one of his daily prayer in the corner of the kitchen and everybody was cool with that. In 2015 Yelp officially participated in the SF pride parade. Yelp has at least a couple engineers with noticeable impairments and does a great job helping them to be happy, successful members of the team.\r\n* Tons of awesome events, including learning lunches on Fridays (and sometimes Mondays too) with presentations on cool eclectic topics, movie nights, trivia nights, board games nights, women engineering groups, a variety of meetup events (e.g. python, machine learning), and more!\r\n* Management is very open to ideas and supportive of work done by engineers. If you think of a cool, challenging project that benefits the company, chances are that you'll get to work on it.\r\n\r\nI was not looking for another job when I left Yelp, and it was a tough decision to leave this company. I've worked or interned at 5 companies now, and I have been the happiest at Yelp.",
          "cons": "There aren't many cons to working at Yelp as an engineer. However, now that the company is fairly big (4000-5000 employees) you cannot realistically expect rapid career advancement as you would at a successful, small startup unless you work really hard (I choose to maintain a good work/life balance and was very happy with that choice) or are ridiculously brilliant.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, the management claims that a well-performing engineer can be just as well compensated regardless of whether s/he pursues a path in management or remains a talented software engineer. However, based on my experiences I don't believe this is 100% true. Not that differing compensation is unreasonable, I just wish that management would not make this claim (unless I'm mistaken).",

When the dust clears from this down cycle, only a few players are going to remain, and Prosper is one of them. They have the size and execution that very few others do, and you'd be hard pressed to find another Valley startup that has as successful a product and as much room to scale in their market. \r\n\r\nIt's not a question of growth. It's a question of meeting the challenge of continuing to grow so fast.\r\n\r\nHaving been an engineer at Prosper multiple years, I have seen it go through management changes and ups and downs. It hasn't always been easy. More than a few of the reviews on here reflect that struggle to find the right team to build a great engineering culture for long-term sustainable success. Through it all, the core executive team has demonstrated that they are thoughtful and patient and they value people, sometimes to a fault. And contrary to what some reviewers have said, they have the humility to admit that they are growing as leaders and sometimes make mistakes.\r\n\r\nNow more than ever, that core team has the Product and Engineering leadership to really get it right. To address tech debt while delivering scale and doing what the business needs to weather a down market and emerge stronger.\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of interesting problems to solve, and if you are a hungry talented person, you will get every chance to solve them.",
          "cons": "- There is tech debt\r\n- The product release process is cumbersome (but improving).\r\n- State-of-the-industry best practices among developers are improving but unevenly distributed",

This is like a massively funded start up with a mission to really change the way the big machinery of the world works. There's nothing else like it in silicon valley so if the mission is important to you, this is a really unique situation to do something with massive potential.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to getting this done and providing what it thinks it needs to make it so. Lots of money and growth being thrown at this.\r\n\r\nThe company is slowly figuring out that they need to make this much more like an actual software company and are gradually changing the facility to look and act that way, with snacks, pool tables and other amenities.",
          "cons": "No matter how much they try to sell it to us, this is not a start up inside a big company. It's many thousand people strong already and there are the inevitable big company politics that influence too much of the major decision making. Generally speaking the longer an exec has been with GE the less capable they seem to be at thinking lean or agile. Instead they look to add to their empires by adding more people to solve problems that are overblown. Fortunately they are slowly replacing these guys with more local talent that seems to have a better handle on building software at scale.",

The company is growing at a crazy pace. Gracenote just acquired couple of small sports companies & launched new Sports vertical on top of existing Music & Video verticals\r\n\r\n- Being a small company many core products are developed by small teams. Ability to be part of product from design to delivery phase. Provides significant opportunity for one to contribute & deliver impact. Ex: The entire Gracenote Mobile SDK's for iOS, Android & Windows is managed by a team of 3 people.  \r\n\r\n- Smart & friendly peers. Meetings are short & to the point.

It can be tough emotionally if you've never experienced workplace turmoil before (especially for the impressionable young engineers). Some of the more experienced engineers have left for the likes of Facebook, which in a way validates the level of engineering talent.\r\n\r\nBeing a private company in adtech, it is hard to attach a value to the stock options if you are looking for a short-term pay-off.",

There will be times when people feel the need to work overtime but it is not the norm.  \r\nThe problems are interesting and feel important.  Sure you can burn out on anything but there is a ton of interesting work at the lab.\r\nOn that note, the lab has so many projects going on that if you need something new after a few years you can find something fresh to re-invigorate you.\r\nFinally the pay is pretty decent for the area.  Yes you will get more money at the big companies further west, but the cost of living around the lab is way more in line with lab salaries than with other companies.\r\nFinal advice, if you are a fresh grad and can grind for a bit, go to one of the big companies and make some serious dough.  If you appreciate work life balance, want to spend time with your family, and want a decent quality of life, this is a great place.",

They have a classification system worked out but it is only a few years new at this point and they are only just starting to define and coach employees on how one would get a promotion.\r\nBeing a government funded facility, we are at the mercy of the federal budget.  When stuff like the government shut down happens, or salaries are frozen for federal workers, it affects us.\r\nThe frills and niceties of other companies are non-existent here.  Here are some examples: when taking someone on a lunch interview, the lab will not do the courtesy of paying for your interviewees lunch, you have to pay out of your pocket;  Many buildings have cramped hallways and not so nice bathrooms (not gas station bathrooms, but not nice bathrooms); Many buildings have only basic custodial services, i.e. you'll be cleaning the fridge out yourself.",

In my current project, I rarely work more than 40 hours per week.  Also, the company has been around for a long time and is very stable... it's never had a round of layoffs in the &gt; 10 years I've been there.  Turnover is very low compared to traditional software companies.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really like about this company is the software is used in so many industries outside of the tech sector... primarily connecting to automation control systems used for manufacturing, oil and gas, energy production, chemical, pharmaceuticals etc.  Talking to our customers is like watching an episode of \"How It's Made\".  I've learned a lot.",

However, if a big company with a lot of resources decided they wanted to compete in these markets, the company would probably be in trouble.\r\n\r\nAlso, from a software standpoint, much of the technology being used is somewhat dated (legacy stuff) without a lot of real interesting innovation happening in many dev groups.  There's some effort recently to change that however.",

          "pros": "Credit Karma is fantastic because it tackles interesting technological questions at a great location with smart people who care about one another.\r\n\r\nFrom an engineering perspective, we constantly have to tackle challenging problems. We build native applications for two mobile platforms and for the Web; we work with two credit bureaus and dozens of financial partners (and we're constantly onboarding more partners), each with its own APIs and technical demands; we constantly have to ensure the security of our users' personal information; and we're always building new features to provide the most comprehensive set of credit information on the Web. Each employee is given a stipend to attend (and is encouraged to apply to speak at) technical conferences.\r\n\r\nAs to company culture, we have perks and experiences that are tough to beat. Like most tech companies, we have fully-stocked kitchens (healthy and less healthy snacks, breakfast cereal, bagels, keg coolers for both beer and iced coffee, etc.) and game rooms (with multiple gaming consoles and a rotating set of vintage arcade games). We convert two of the kitchens into yoga studios twice a week for free yoga classes that are open to all employees. On Wednesday afternoons and Friday afternoons there are often happy hours or other events like trivia nights, movie nights, outings to the Giants game (with an opportunity to go out on the field beforehand during batting practice!), etc. In addition, we have regular company retreats - we did a day at the zoo back in October 2014, had a company Field Day in June (with sumo suits, bubble soccer, a pie eating contest, and more), and recently got to go to the batting cages in AT&T Park and meet Draymond Green after the JP Morgan Corporate Challenge road race.\r\n\r\nUltimately, though, your experience is defined by the people you work most closely with. Credit Karma's employees universally buy in to its culture - great work/life balance, celebrating each other's accomplishments, etc. To encourage team cohesion, teams (engineering and non-engineering) will go to nice dinners as a group and participate in other team-bonding events (one team is going sailing on the Bay later this week). On the rare occasions when a team member experiences a personal setback (illness in the family, injury, etc.), other members of the team will pick up the slack without question. That sense of giving spills over into the broader community: Credit Karma sponsors blood drives, toy drives, volunteering at coding camps for needy children, and other events that have an impact beyond its walls. Working in an office that promotes empathy, wellness, and happiness is a recipe for productivity and employee retention.",
          "cons": "Like any company that has old code and a larger engineering team, Credit Karma still has to deal with legacy code and with cross-team integration for software written by one team but consumed by another. In addition, although we have plenty of space, we're situated on two different floors in each of two different buildings; the two floors in the larger building are also not consecutive floors. It would be great if we could move into our own building or if we could have adjoining floors to facilitate cross-team participation.",

          "pros": "Pair programming all day every day means that you will be learning and teaching constantly.  After four years, I'm still surprised nearly every day with how much I learn just by observing and interacting with my colleagues.  There are awesome catered breakfasts every morning, endless\r\nsnacks, and a whole group of superstars called the \"Happiness team\" who keep office life weird and awesome.  Work-life balance is a core benefit extended to every individual contributor on the floor.  Overtime is totally unheard of.  Your workday will start at 9am, end at 6pm, and your phone will never ring outside of work hours.\r\n\r\nThe company's core values are: \"do the right thing\", \"do what works\", and \"be kind\".  Management and labor in the Pivotal Labs organization (a services division inside of Pivotal), strive to live up to these lofty ideals and they succeed more often than not.  I've seen management on more than one occasion turn down business from clients who were unkind or unprofessional in sales meetings.  Since upper management has strong positive and negative incentives to bring in business, turning away a client who is likely to make the Pivots on the floor unhappy is a strong signal that management truly does take the long view and values the creation of a nurturing and sustainable workplace environment over short-term gains.\r\n\r\nOccasionally you will be staffed on a very challenging project with a client who doesn't fully see the value of some of our more esoteric practices.  You'll sit next to passive-aggressive client developers who will complain bitterly about writing tests, or pairing, or just want to do things their own way.  Try and treat these engagements as the learning and growth opportunities they are.  Make sure that you are truly empathizing with your \"difficult\" clients (or difficult co-workers) and bring an attitude of humility and willingness to change your opinion when faced with facts, like for instance, the fact that despite writing a lot of tests a product still has frequent regressions when new features are added, etc.  Weekly retrospectives are an opportunity to speak directly with your product team about what's not going well and how to immediately change your team's process to make it better.  Over time I've learned that being direct (remembering also to be kind), is almost always the best approach.  In most cases, even on the most challenging projects I've worked on, clients eventually see the value of some parts of our process and come to adopt them.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Pivotal Labs is a fantastic place to work and I've benefited tremendously from my time there.  I highly recommend it as a workplace for software developers who want to learn a process for continuously improving their craft.  If you come in with an open mind, you will grow tremendously in technical ability and in the ability to empathize with your clients and co-workers.",
          "cons": "Salaries lag behind industry standard.  I've seen many of the most talented employees leave because they felt their professional development wasn't progressing rapidly enough.  These folks in many cases were among the most productive members of the office.  People coming and going is normal for a consultancy, perhaps it's just the name of the game, but I suspect that more could be done to retain our best folks.",

They put micro-managers in who will tell you to do a project and then try to manage it from above or around you - getting resources involved at inappropriate times, telling others to do something on a project you're supposed to be managing.   software engineers will end up with projects where they have all the responsibility for success and no way to get cooperation from the other people/groups.  There was no IT function for a long time, so there were people programming who shouldn't have been and there is a lot of 'quick and dirty' stuff in every environment you can name.  If you don't have a car, just getting there can be a pain. Plan on spending quite a bit of time standing on a street corner in Berkeley or a BART platform or at a bus stop on the hill.

I was also not a big fan of the widespread SAFE methodology and the over-reliance on tools like Rally which created lots of overhead. \r\n\r\nWorking with Japan is interesting  but also very frustrating at times, especially as they have ownership of the platform.\r\n\r\nFinally, very limited remote work options, given that most of the work requires devkits that can't be accessed outside the office.",

I love the company and it was the reason I chose it over other offers I had at the time. But I wish I could have a better manager. I don't wish to be in another team because all my teammates are knowledgeable and fun to work with. It's just weird how a manger of a hard core back end team doesn't like coding and spent most of his time in meetings without implementing any important piece of code while the company is still a startup. It's ok to be in meetings but it's not right when you are an engineer lead and have more meetings than your project manager. Yes we have a PM. All the team members could see the problem, brought it up but nothing changed. I don't want to go in more details, but I do want to see Glassdoor successful. Look back at the journey I had at Glassdoor, I do realize I learnt many things from my teammates. I'm glad to know and have them in my life. I don't regret my choice, I just wish it could be better for everyone. \r\n\r\nTo any new grad: choose your manager for your first job, it should be the highest priority because he/she will be your mentor (or no mentorship at all if you choose a wrong one).",

There is no behind the scene politics or strict requirements for schedule, location, PTOs, etc. \r\n\r\nHiring smart friendly people and giving them enough autonomy works for Rev so far. I couldn't imagine company may have such a healthy climate inside. \r\n\r\nYou commit to some change in the product, and you make it happen. Nobody just hands you an issue with a deadline. Team responsibility, planning and estimation makes a great foundation to not stressing about work beyond work time. At this size and structure of product teams we can roll with the punches and release regularly. I really hope company growth won't complicate the structure we have now significantly.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest benefits for me - you work alongside senior engineers with years of experience, so learning never stops.\r\n\r\nAfter all of this, I can easily skip many small perks which many cool companies around have.",

It is really easy to see the passion some of my coworkers have for making a difference in our customers' financial lives. It is personally incredibly rewarding to be working for a company that is actually making a huge difference.\r\n\r\n3) The people here have that rare combination of brilliance and approachability. Regular brown bags, design reviews, retros. Sasha, the CEO, regularly sits down to eat lunch with new people.\r\n\r\n4) This is a fast-paced environment where everyone has a great deal of responsibility and impact on the product. New hires can start shipping code on day 1. Employees are encouraged to voice their opinions, questions, and concerns regularly and there are many safe channels to do so\r\n\r\n5) Comp and benefits are pretty good (not Google/Twitter good but hey, we're a startup). Everyone gets equity\r\n\r\n6) Unlimited vacation if you get your work done\r\n\r\n7) Diversity! Our engineering team is surprisingly eclectic and range from all walks of life",

Vevo has more video views per month that all but a small number of companies, so knowing your work touches millions every day is exciting, but Vevo is still small enough the organization is still fairly flat, everyone has a say, and you will not be held back by anything if you want to tackle tough problems.  Most people here do not let ambition get in the way of having fun, however, so there is a certain laid-back vibe, with music playing a lot in the background, lots of ping pong games and socializing.  So there's a range of experiences here, depending on what each person wants out of their job.  Salary and benefits are very competitive.",

Communication between technical teams in different offices still leaves a lot to be desired, and roles & responsibilities between groups could be better defined -- some important work slips through the cracks because no one seems to own it.  The profit sharing plan does not offer the same upside as equity in a start-up; then again, this company that's already profitable, and most start-ups never get there, so you just need to decide what's important to you.",
