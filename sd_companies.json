What triggered your decision to leave ACTIVE?\r\n\r\n1) Executives hiding behind an NDA so that they don't have to tell employees about company plans.  Good news is shared.  Only bad news is \"hidden\", though they do a poor job of hiding anything -- everyone hears the leaks and knows about the plans.\r\n2) Developers showing up from China unannounced to take over work from US-based teams.  This is the most bone-headed move I have ever seen in my years as an engineer.  Fear does not drive performance.  Nobody is going to stick around when there is a chance that they could instantly be replaced by a team from China.\r\n3) Comments that can only be described as completely idiotic, made by the CEO during company-wide briefings.  \"Look to your left, look to your right, one of them isn't going to be working here any more\".  These comments do nothing to build employee trust in the leadership or the direction of the company, and they made my job as a manager even more difficult.\r\n4) Replacement of San Diego-based skilled engineers with \"senior engineers\" in China who might be cheaper but are completely unqualified to be working on enterprise software systems.  I interviewed a couple of these folks, and the office manager in China even told me that I \"had\" to hire one of them.  If I \"had\" to hire one of them, why did I waste my time on the interview?\r\n5) Failure by the management to identify critical employees and retain them, and to hire replacements for engineers who have left.  One of my teams once had 7 engineers; now we only have 2.  This is a team that is mission critical.  The team is now down to two relatively junior to mid-level engineers.\r\n6) Failure on the executives' part to recognize that highly skilled and highly experienced people are working under them.  Active is not the military, and nobody here enjoys taking orders.  The last straw for me was having the R&D metrics forced upon myself and my teams, with no chance to provide feedback.  I ultimately saw that there was zero chance of being able to perform well under this system, which changed the calculus for me remaining here vs. moving to a new position elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be clear: most people, and most managers at this company are highly skilled, experienced and capable.  It's the people at the very top - the executives - that have brought this ship down.",

          "pros": "Great work life balance. There are so few tech companies (particularly global corporations) that care enough about their employees home life as to encourage weekends off.  401K matching was terrific as well and the medical/dental benefits were top rate until the last year. Working with the latest in wireless technologies, software and test equipment.   Great co-workers whom not only know and ply their trade effectively but couldn't care less about office politics..",
          "cons": "Decisions by upper management and executives... yes, this is gripe often heard in the corporate world. However, when you go from one \"burning platform\" and jump head long into another \"burning platform\" (ie Windows Phone) it became a more steady decline.  The Metro UI of Windows 7 and 8 is unique, but hardly a favorite among mobile phone users. The early death of the Microsoft Kin mobile phone should have rang alarm bells.... not to mention the fact that Windows 7 devices couldn't be upgraded to 8, and the lack of apps (which should have been tackled early on)..",

Yearly performance reviews.\r\nOpportunity to move around among projects & roles.  \r\nInformal team gatherings at happy hours, lunches etc.  \r\nSupportive work environment leading to better project outcomes.\r\nEmployee volunteer days are lots of fun and benefit the local community.\r\nYou can probably make more money elsewhere but over the years I've seen several engineers leave for more $$ and then return in a year or two for the work life balance and lower stress atmosphere.\r\nThe positive team dynamics help engineers to excel.  Because engineers tend to stay for years, there's a willingness to invest and train.  Teamwork is valued highly and included in yearly reviews.\r\n9/80 schedule with off Fridays.  \r\nOccasional paid overtime.\r\nGood retention rates allow long term working relationships to develop.",

Coworkers are a great bunch of people who, while very diverse, get along well and are respectful of each other.  There’s always a fun social event to participate in.  Benefits are pretty good (I don’t know what other companies are offering but I’ve been happy with the benefits).",
          "cons": "Over the past three years, the San Diego office has seen a new senior VP, two additional VPs, multiple directors and senior architects and managers all come in from the same company (Intuit).  At the same time, the existing senior Sony people have been squeezed out, quietly encouraged to leave, or just fired.  No one from the original Sony Network San Diego in any position of responsibility and no one from the original Sony days has been promoted.  There have been many new senior level positions filled, but none from within the company.  Some have been given new titles, but no real promotions.  Existing engineers have not been allowed to participate in the technical direction of the network.  They are seen as hindrances and not as contributors.  A closed environment of fear and distrust has been created where people cannot question direction or voice honest opinions.  It’s a dreary engineering environment lacking in excitement or peer collaboration.",

Working with her team I went in for an interview within a week and then was eventually considered for a better/higher position which I interviewed for several weeks later.  I really enjoyed working with the insight global team, they were very supportive and gave good advice on salary, contract to hire rates etc. that ended up getting me the best possible outcome: full time job, great salary, and good timeline for transition.  There were no surprises for the hiring company because Kory did a great job of communicating all the important issues up front.",

They have one of the best campuses and the building is full of expensive art. They pay me well and I don’t have much to complain about as far as compensation and benefits. They have a gym onsite and good health programs which show their commitment to employee welfare. The senior management is progressive and we are set for a period of huge growth over the next few years.",
          "cons": "As you can see they have a good overall structure in place to make it a great place to work. However that is where all the pros end. They are hiring a lot of people at this point and it's important that you read this review before you make a decision on joining the HI division. \r\n\r\nSo it turns out we acquired a little mom-and-pop shop from Halifax and the overlords from that company are currently in the process of taking over the Healthcare Informatics division. There is rampant cronyism and the CEO of the mom-and-pop shop that has taken over us is busy promoting his own clueless incompetent people since the last 1 year or so. People who know very little about technology have gone from being first-line supervisors to Directors within a period of 6 months to a year. All this would be easy to ignore if this new management were fair or smart or knew what they were doing. People who were smart, understood business and technology and had big ideas have been turned into puppets of the new management. These new managers chill all dissent and punish people whose opinions they don’t like by sidelining them, demoting them or creating an environment in which people are forced to leave. The company has hired experts in many areas in the last couple of years but these experts are completely ignored and sidelined and eventually let go because their views don’t match with the clueless incompetent managers, leads and directors that work in the HI division. So if you are the type of person who has ideas and interest in changing things then this is absolutely one of the worst place to come to. These are things you should seriously consider because it is extremely frustrating and insecure to work here.",
